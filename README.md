## Author Similarity 
This repository uses word embeddings (GloVe) to compare the similarity of famous authors' works
from the Gutenberg Dataset (https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~lahiri/gutenberg_dataset.html). This project could be
extended to make book recommendations in an unsupervised fashion using nearest neighbors search.
